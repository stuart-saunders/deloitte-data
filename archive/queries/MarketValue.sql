European Market Dominated by the top leagues Big 5 Nations of England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France

Between 2015 and 2022, the Market as a whole has increased by 35% (21.8 => 29.5)

Biggest growth, in percentage terms has been the International game (Governing Bodies and National Associations), 
but still dwarfed in finanical terms by the top leagues of the Big 5.

Big 5 top leagues represent 58% of the market in 2022, up from 55% in 2015.

Between 2015 and 2022, Big 5's top leagues have had by far the biggest growth, at 43%, with the others trailing in the teens.

Big 5 top leagues are increasing market share, and growing at more than 3 times the rate of the lower leagues in those countries,
and way in excess of twice the rate of the leagues outside of the biggest nations.
